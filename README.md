Project Description:

Title: Stock Bot: Automated Trading System Using API Integration

Description:
The Stock Bot project aims to develop an intelligent and automated trading system that leverages the power of an Application Programming Interface (API) to gather real-time stock market data and make informed investment decisions. This project combines the realms of finance, programming, and data analysis to create a robust tool for traders and investors. Through creating this STock Bot Project, we hope to develop a better software, allowing for all people getting into stock to be able to understand how stocks work better and how they can be used in many ways to be helpful.

The primary objective of the Stock Bot is to provide users with an intelligent trading assistant capable of monitoring multiple stocks, analyzing market trends, and executing trades based on predefined strategies or user-defined parameters. By integrating with a reliable and feature-rich financial API, the bot gains access to a vast array of historical and real-time stock market data, enabling it to make data-driven investment decisions.

Key Features:

API Integration: The Stock Bot will be designed to seamlessly integrate with a reputable financial API, such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Interactive Brokers, to retrieve stock market data including historical prices, company fundamentals, technical indicators, and news sentiment.

Real-Time Data Analysis: Leveraging the power of the integrated API, the bot will continuously monitor and analyze real-time market data, enabling it to identify potential trading opportunities, detect patterns, and generate accurate forecasts for various stocks.

Trade Execution: The bot will be equipped with a trading engine that can execute trades automatically based on predefined trading strategies. Users will have the flexibility to define their own strategies or utilize built-in algorithms for buying, selling, or holding stocks.

Portfolio Management: The Stock Bot will provide portfolio management capabilities, allowing users to track their investments, monitor performance, and receive notifications for key events, such as price thresholds being reached or significant news impacting their holdings.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard will be developed to provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the bot. The dashboard will display real-time market data, performance metrics, trade history, and customizable alerts.

Backtesting and Simulation: The bot will support backtesting functionalities, enabling users to evaluate the performance of trading strategies using historical data. This feature will help users fine-tune their strategies and make informed decisions based on past performance.

Security and Privacy: Robust security measures will be implemented to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. The bot will adhere to industry-standard security protocols and best practices to safeguard user accounts and trading activities.

The Stock Bot project combines the power of automation, data analysis, and API integration to create a sophisticated tool for traders and investors. By leveraging real-time market data, intelligent algorithms, and user-defined strategies, the bot aims to assist users in making more informed investment decisions and improving overall trading performance.

Note: The project's scope and features can be adjusted based on the available API, resources, and specific requirements of the developer.









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.





Jay: 
Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion.

In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.)

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.

However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella.

Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.

Prince v.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.

Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.

In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion.

The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests.

However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.

Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors.

Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held. Additionally, he covers the idea that the first amendment was added as a guarantee that the federal government, however powerful, could not support or even influence the kind of prayers in America. As public schools like Placer high school are state-run, keeping a healthy separation between that and religion is essential, just like the forefathers intended. Forms of religious symbolism can be considered as established, and even though the Cherokee are a minority, it is still essential to acknowledge the precedents set in cases like Engel v Vitale. In Engel v Vitale, the prayers were nondenominational and voluntary and could be interpreted as not having much effect on students who do not participate; this is similar to the eagle feather situation. However, our constitution is strict on the separation of church and state, so any form of prayer or religious symbols can be considered as imposing religion which is unacceptable in settings like public schools, which are state-run due to the precedent set in Engel v Vitale.  
Placer High School set its policy of no decoration or modification to graduation caps after a disruptive incident in 2014. This policy applies to all students, regardless of their cultural background, religious beliefs, or personal preferences. Every request for cap alteration since 2015 has been denied. This is not a case of discrimination. It is a neutral policy created in order  to prevent disruptions and maintain order at the graduation ceremony.
It is crucial to note that Mr. Starr was not denied the right to express his religious and cultural beliefs. The school’s policy does not prohibit him from wearing traditional Cherokee clothing, jewelry, or other symbols of his heritage. The only restriction was on altering the graduation cap, a restriction applied equally to all students, regardless of their cultural or religious identity.

May it please the court,

We are here today to represent Principal Catherine Smith and Placer High School in the matter brought against them by Eric Starr and his parents. The Starr family claims that Principal Smith's decision to enforce the school's policy prohibiting decoration or modification to graduation caps violates Eric's First Amendment rights, specifically his freedom to practice his religion. We are here to present our case that Principal Smith's actions did not violate Mr. Starr's rights. But instead, were necessary as part of their educational policy as a school.

Our client Catherine Smith, principal of Placer high school, was forced to deny participation in the graduation to Erik Starr because he altered his graduation cap. Before this, he had asked for permission to wear it however was denied. Smith was forced to disallow the feather due to the fact that in  In 2014, a protest over student alteration occurred among the students in the middle of the ceremony, which disrupted the event. After this incident, any requests for alterations were denied even though numerous requests for alternations occur yearly. Starr is of Cherokee descent, and the feather has a significant spiritual meaning. However, there is a strict universal code at the school against any form of alteration so that the educational process is not disrupted, which is the power given to the school and its administration. Oklahoma does have a law that permits students to wear Native American and religious attachments at public high schools. However, schools can suppress speech, including the free exercise clause, if the educational process is disrupted. As a result, the law is not universally true, as many schools and districts deny students' requests.

While we respect the cultural significance of the eagle feather to Mr. Starr and his Cherokee heritage, it is crucial to consider the larger educational context. The idea here is to minimize disruptions to the educational environment. Furthermore, it is essential to note the distinction between the right to express one’s religious beliefs to the right to disrupt an event that is a part of the educational process. Our first argument is built upon this difference. We want to differentiate the demand for an exception to an applied policy that everyone must follow, which could potentially cause disruptions from the right to exercise one's religion freely.



In the case of Bethel School board V. Fraser(1986), Matthew Fraser made a speech in front of approximately six hundred students at his school, nominating his friend for the student council, using numerous graphic sexual metaphors. The Bethel school district claimed his actions affected and interfered with the educational process, which notes profanity and obscene images as part of that. He was then suspended for 2 days. The school district had enforced a strict policy against “the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.” Fraser took action by claiming that the school was unjust for suppressing his speech and that it was unfair that he was suspended. However, this ruling was plain and simple as the school's primary argument was based on the set from the dissenting opinion of the Tinker v Des Moines (1969) case, which highlighted that a school had the right to suppress speech if it disrupts the educational process. Now when it came to interpretation, the judges nearly unanimously agreed that lewd and sexual speech in an educational environment is a disruption to the educational process as it is inappropriate in any form of the learning environment. This allowed for the idea that schools should have the power to censor and suspend speech only because it disrupts the educational process to be set as a precedent. Based on these precedent can suppress any form of speech, including the free exercise clause in the first amendment, allowing Mr. Starr to practice his religion in the case of the eagle feather. And normally, not just outside of school but in school as a result of the precedent set by Tinker v Demoines, students have the right to protest and exercise their speech, including religious expression, under its umbrella. However, the dissenting opinion from justice black in Tinker v Des Moines and the precedent set in Bethel School board V. Fraser, address that schools have the right to suppress speech if it alters or affects the educational process. This idea of disrupting the educational process can be interpreted differently; however, in the case of Mr.Starr, his action of altering the graduation cap had a history of protests. The fact that he was able to alter his clothing could potentially cause students who also put in similar requests to protest against such a decision. This is what had occurred previously in 2014, which led to the rule banning alterations. And on the precedent set by Bethel School board V. Fraser, the rule of banning alterations is just as it protects the educational process from disruption.   Maintaining an appropriate and orderly environment is more important for the school. If Mr. Starr's request had been granted, it might have been viewed as favoritism against other students who were also denied their requests for cap alterations based on the same policy. This could have led to further protests or disruptions, similar to the incident in 2014, and thus would be considered a disruption of the educational process.
Talk about how free exercise clause is used except when there is compelling government interest such as a case in 1944
Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Supreme Court held that a state could force the inoculation or vaccinations of children whose parents would not allow such action for religious reasons. The Court held that the state had an overriding interest in protecting public health and safety.

Sentiments aside, the argument I will be making neither takes an emotional nor an empathetic stance, rather it is based strictly on the constitution and previous precedents. The following case is Engel v Vitale(1962) which involved a 22-word nondenominational prayer which means that the prayer is not connected to a specific religion.  The New York Board of Regents recommended this prayer to school districts. This prayer was adopted as voluntary participation in several districts. This was then challenged by Engel a Jewish man. He claimed this voluntary nondenominational prayer violated first amendment rights, specifically under the establishment clause. While previously in the past the establishment clause was used to highlight the separation between the church and state, in modern times  what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Under the "Lemon" test, the government can assist religion only if (1) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular( not subject to or bound by religious rule; not belonging to or living in a monastic or other order.) The feather, for example, is a powerful symbol which does signify honor; however it also displays the connection between and I quote “the owner, the Creator, and the bird from which the feather came.” This itself violates the primary purpose as the “Creator” varies per religion and refers to a God, (2) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and (3) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. This clause highlights the separation between church and state, and by imposing prayers, it could be considered that the schools are imposing a one faith fits all prayer for those who may believe in faith or may not wholly believe in any religion. This was important to challenge because any form of religion can be deemed offensive and forceful, even if it is voluntary. Engel and several other parents took this case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parents in a six-to-one vote. As a result, Justice Black wrote on the topic of historical religious discrimination and intolerance in England and how the Constitution addresses the dangers of a union between church and state. Even in this case there was controversy because people believed that their ability to exercise their religion freely, however because of compelling government interest and a clear violation of the Establishment Clause the precedent was still held.
